<h1>Hello everyone.</h1>
<h2>Please read the following before making your way through the repository.</h2>
<p>This repository contains everything that was submitted as my final matric Practical Assessment Task in 2025. This includes documentation and the code itself. This repository is meant to serve as a reference point as to how to do your own PAT, for I know the rubric can be rather vague and confusing at times. This is not to say that this is exactly what the IEB is looking for, as at the end of the day, this is only another student's interpretation of the rubric and its requirements. These are not solutions, but guides. This material here has been uploaded here in hopes that it will be used in good faith and will genuienly aid studetns with their PATs. Please (really pretty please) don't be the one to use this to copy and paste code and documentation for your own project and documentation. Again, this is meant to help you with your PAT and not be your PAT (plagirism isn't cool).</p>
<p>The PAT that is found in this repository is a lot more extensive than what is needed to get a good mark for your PAT, and I would not recommend making your project as extensive as this. However, I thought that since this project covers a lot of other and different topics, libraries, techniques, etc., everyone will be able to find something useful for themselves.</p>
<p>So yeah, I hope you find the following somewhat useful. Enjoy working on your PAT.</p>
